NAME
    Template::Benchmark - Pluggable benchmarker to cross-compare template
    systems.

VERSION
    version 1.09_02

DESCRIPTION
    Template::Benchmark provides a pluggable framework for cross-comparing
    performance of various template engines across a range of supported
    features for each, grouped by caching methodology.

    If that's a bit of a mouthful... have you ever wanted to find out the
    relative performance of template modules that support expression parsing
    when running with a shared memory cache? Do you even know which ones
    *allow* you to do that? This module lets you find that sort of thing
    out.

    As of current writing, there are plugins to let you compare the
    performance and features of 21 different perl template engines in a
    total of 75 different configurations.

    If you're just after results, then you should probably start with the
    benchmark_template_engines script first, it provides a commandline UI
    onto Template::Benchmark and gives you human-readable reports as a reply
    rather than a raw hashref, it also supports JSON output if you want to
    dump the report somewhere in a machine-readable format.

    If you have no template engines already installed, or you want to
    benchmark everything supported, I suggest you also look at the
    Task::Template::Benchmark distribution which installs all the optional
    requirements for Template::Benchmark.
